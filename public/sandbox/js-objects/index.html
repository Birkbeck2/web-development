      <h1>The Fox and the Grapes</h1>
      <p>A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a
      vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to
      burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at
      them.</p>
      <p>The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it.
      The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a
      short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once
      more. Again and again he tried, but in vain.</p>
      <p>Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust.</p>
      <p>"What a fool I am," he said. "Here I am wearing myself out to get a
      bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for".</p>
      <p>And off he walked very, very scornfully.</p>
