# Workshop: Animating Data

Get a GitHub repository for this workshop in moodle. Homework will be to finish this workshop and publish your code to GitHub Pages, within 5 days.  

## Animating with open JSON data from the web

Create an HTML file and a linked JavaScript file.  

Use the fetch API to get some open data from the web.  
Examples of APIs you could use include:  
[Emojis API](https://api.github.com/emojis)  
[Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/)  
[Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)  
[Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/)  
Or look at some open data sources on this page:  
[Awesome JSON datasets](https://github.com/jdorfman/awesome-json-datasets).  
Some of the links here might not work, but many will.  

Use [JSON Beautify](https://jsonbeautify.com/) to look at the JSON and format/beautify it.  

Try putting something onto the canvas using data from the JSON you fetched, then animate it using either `setTimeout()` or `setInterval()`.

If your JSON data links images animate them on the canvas using `requestAnimationFrame()`.  

Or use JSON data to draw and animate shapes on the canvas using `requestAnimationFrame()`

Or if you have chosen an API which has text or numerical data, draw an animated representation of this data on the canvas element using `requestAnimationFrame()`.  

If you have time, add interactivity to your program through an event which manipulates what is drawn to the canvas in some way.
