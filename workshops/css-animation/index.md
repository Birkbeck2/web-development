# Workshop on CSS animation

This workshop asks you to brainstorm animations that you might add to your website, choose one, and try it out in a separate webpage and style sheet.

## Setup

1. Create a repository by following the link on Moodle.

2. Create an empty `index.html` and a CSS file to go with it.

3. Publish the site with GitHub Pages.

4. Clone it to your computer and open it in your code editor.

## Brainstorm animations

5. Make a list of ideas for possible animations you could add to your fictional website. Try to get to 10 if you can. Include this list in the `index.html` file.

## Make a prototype

6. Choose one of the ideas and try it out. Write enough HTML to form a base for the animation, and add CSS to see if you can create a prototype of the animation.

## Requirements checklist

If you have already completed 5 homeworks, you do not need to turn this in for credit.

Here are the minimum requirements for credit when you turn this workshop in as homework.

- The site is published via GitHub Pages.
- When you go to the site URL, the `index.html` page loads, and it has the required elements in the right place, like `head`, `body`, etc.
- The `index.html` includes a list of animation ideas.
- There is a prototype animation that uses CSS from the `transition-*` and/or `animation-*` property groups.
- If the user has turned on reduced motion on their operating system, no motion or only very small motion occurs, and all motion contributes to usability.
