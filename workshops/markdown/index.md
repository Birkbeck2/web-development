In this workshop, you will write a webpage about your goals for the course. You will use Markdown syntax to write the page, and finally you will publish your webpage privately on GitHub Pages.

Time estimate: 30 minutes

## Getting set up

1. Create an [account on GitHub](https://github.com/signup) and log in. Note that your
   Birkbeck email address must be tied to the GitHub account, either as the
   main email associated with the account or as a secondary one.

2. Create a GitHub repository that is associated with [Birkbeck2 organization on
   GitHub](https://github.com/Birkbeck2). To do this, you need to go to
   Moodle and find today’s tile. Click on the special link there that says
   **Create GitHub Repository**.

## Creating your content

3. Create a file in your new repository called `index.md`. It has to be named like this for GitHub to recognize it as the default main page that should be loaded.

4. Write some content! Your instructor would love to read answers to these questions, presented however you’d like (lists, tables, paragraphs, subheadings, links, images, etc.), so long as you use appropriate Markdown syntax.

  * Tell me a bit about your current or recent job. What do you do for a living?
  * Did anything happen in your job recently that relates to web development?
  * Do you have any creative projects outside of your job that you are excited about?
  * What kinds of jobs will you apply for after your MA degree or PG certificate?
  * Is there anything else about you and your learning goals that you want me to know?

5. Make sure you included at least one image. Use one that shows some of your previous creative work, if you have it, or use one of Joe’s cats:

   ![Matilda](../../lectures/images/matilda.avif)
   Matilda

   ![Iggy](../../lectures/images/iggy.avif)
   Iggy

   ::: tip
   To include the image, upload it separately (try a new browser tab
   if you have unsaved edits in the text file), and then type out the filename in the
   parenthetical Markdown reference.
   :::

   ::: info
   GitHub also lets you drag and drop the image into
   the text editor, which creates a `user-attachments` link. But user
   attachments can’t be updated or edited manually and don’t belong to the version
   control of the repository, so it’s best to avoid relying on them when
   working in repositories.

6. Use the **Preview** tab to check the output.

7. Save your work often and early by using the **Commit** button. When GitHub asks you for a commit message, this is a note to your future self, as part of [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)’s version control features. When it asks about branches, you can just choose the `main` branch.

## Publishing and making fixes

8. Publish the repository as a website with GitHub Pages. The publishing source should be the `main` branch. Leave the site’s visibility as **Private** for now.

9. Check out your rendered website at the URL provide by GitHub Pages. Is everything displaying as intended? If not, go back and make changes with more commits.
