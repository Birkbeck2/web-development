Welcome! This page is an orientation to the coding side of both of
Birkbeck’s postgraduate modules on digital media design. 

* Web Development and User Experience
* Visual Design and Web Project

The coding sessions in these modules are designed with a single through-line.

## Purpose of coding sessions

You will learn practical coding skills, develop your creative
practice, and form critical perspectives on the issues that commonly face web
development projects.

Finding the right balance of these three will be our constant aim.

## Session format

### Preparation

There is too much material to cover through lecturing, and we know
that students learn best if you have ample time in class to practice,
experiment, get help and feedback, and discuss each other’s work.

So, preparation is essential.

We usually ask you to watch coding videos, and we often also ask you to read
academic articles or textbook chapters.

* Coding videos - essential viewing so you can begin absorbing programming
  concepts and technical syntax and patterns before you get to class

* Academic articles - perfect material to deepen your critical thinking

* Textbook chapters - more systematic and thorough coverage of the same
  ground as the coding videos

### Live coding

We usually begin each session by showing you coding examples and answering
questions about things that you are confused by or stuck on.

It is basically a warm-up for the workshop, and a chance to refresh your memory
of the assigned videos and chapters.

### Workshops

This is the main event of the session, where you can put things into practice
and experiment. Each workshop is different, but we try to provide step-by-step
guide for the practical bit, and more open-ended prompts for creative and
critical work.

Often the workshop will ask you to share a link to your work with everyone, and
we try to include peer review as often as possible.

The practical part of the workshop is often “required” as homework (see **Homeworks**).

### Show and tell

We end each session with an open call for you to share something you made.
All you have to do is put your code on the projector screen, talk us through it
briefly, run it, and take questions.

Many of us come to enjoy this part of the session the most, since we can see each
others’ practice grow and evolve.

### Homeworks

At the coding sessions, we usually assign homeworks to be completed within five
days of the session. The homework is typically just a piece of what you made
in the workshop, so if you are well-prepared and focused, it is possible to
finish your homework during the session.

The purpose is simply to make sure you are making steady progress building your
coding skills, and that you have low-stakes opportunities for instructor feedback.

Homeworks form a very small part of your assessment--one
percent each--and are marked either as full credit or no credit.

Five homeworks are required if you want full credit. But you
will have at least six opportunities to submit a homework, so you can miss one
and still get the full five percent.

## Resources and tools

### Moodle

Birkbeck’s [Moodle](https://moodle.bbk.ac.uk) is the starting place for these
modules and serves as the source of truth, if in doubt about something like
a link, due date, or pre-sessional activities.

### Web Development (this website)

Lecture materials are generally published and stored on this website. It is
public so that it is easier to access and reference regardless of your
enrollment.

We also store some helpful information that is unlikely to change here (like
the page you’re reading), since it is often more accessible and flexible than
Moodle.

### GitHub

GitHub is where you store, share, publish, and submit code projects in these
modules.

#### Repositories

* [Web Development](https://github.com/Birkbeck2/web-development) is the main
  content repository where we keep lecture materials, workshop instructions,
  and code sandboxes and examples.

* [Canary](https://github.com/Birkbeck2/canary) is a private repository for
  collaboration, peer review, and discussion for students enrolled in 2024-25.

* Your repositories will also be stored here, usually associated with the
  Birkbeck organization called “Birkbeck2”. To create Birkbeck-affiliated
  repositories, follow the relevant links on Moodle.

#### Discussions

There is a discussion forum set up inside the Canary repository for
asynchronous sharing, feedback, peer review, discussion, and coding help.

### Computers

You can complete the coding assignments on Birkbeck computers, but a personal
laptop is encouraged if you have reliable access to one. 

It is a good idea to have the same computer for a whole project. As your
projects grow more complex, it can become difficult to switch between
computers, because you have to install and configure several tools for version
control, code editing, and scripting.

### Main assessments

The main assessments are both websites that you create over the course of the
term.

* Autumn - a portfolio website built with HTML and CSS, along with a report
  that critically articulates your coding and design choices

* Spring - a dynamic and/or interactive web project built with HTML, CSS,
  and JavaScript, using your chosen visual language, with a critical report
