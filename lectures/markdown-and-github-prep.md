# Getting started with coding

In this session we will make sure you are set up and familiar with the tools we will code with all year, including GitHub repositories, forums, and pages.

We will also introduce and practice the idea of markup language by writing and structuring some simple content in Markdown.

## Learning objectives

Students will be able to:

- create a repository in GitHub

- create and edit text files in a repository

- upload and manage image files in a repository

- read and write simple content markup in Markdown syntax

- publish a webpage using GitHub Pages

## Pre-sessional activities

::: info
Pre-sessional activities could be readings, videos, or interactive tutorials. Please complete as many as you can before the session, at least the ones listed as Priority.
:::

::: tip
For academic articles, closely read the abstract, introduction, and conclusion first, to try to understand the main argument of the authors. Summarize it in your own words to test if you know the main thing or things they are trying to say. Then go deeper into the methodology, findings, and discussion sections if you can, to understand how and why the authors reached their conclusions.
